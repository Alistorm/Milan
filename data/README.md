## Data

The `data` folder contains the datasets and resources used to train and evaluate Milan's multimodal capabilities and medical knowledge.  This includes:

* **`medical_knowledge_base.json`**: This file contains the structured medical knowledge base used by Milan to answer healthcare-related questions.  The knowledge base is sourced from [Source of medical knowledge, e.g., MedQA dataset, custom curated data]. It is formatted as a JSON file, where each entry represents a medical concept or condition with associated information such as symptoms, treatments, and risk factors.

* **`multimodal_training_data`**: This folder contains the data used to train Milan's multimodal understanding capabilities. It includes:
    * **`audio`**: This subfolder contains WAV files of recorded speech, each labeled with the corresponding emotion expressed (e.g., happy, sad, angry, anxious). The data is sourced from [Source of audio data, e.g., RAVDESS, IEMOCAP].
    * **`video`**: This subfolder contains MP4 files of facial expressions, synchronized with the audio recordings in the `audio` subfolder. Each video file is labeled with the corresponding emotion.  The data is sourced from [Source of video data, e.g., RAVDESS, AffectNet].

* **`mistral_fine_tuning_data.jsonl`**: This JSONL file contains the data used to fine-tune the Mistral large language model on healthcare-specific conversations. The data consists of question-answer pairs and conversation examples related to various health topics. The data is sourced from [Source of Mistral fine-tuning data, e.g., a combination of publicly available datasets and custom-generated conversations].


* **`[Other data resources]`**: [Describe any other data used in the project, such as pre-trained models, word embeddings, or configuration files. Be specific about the file format, source, and purpose of each file]. For example:
    * **`word_embeddings.txt`**: Pre-trained word embeddings used to enhance Milan's natural language understanding. Sourced from [Source of word embeddings, e.g., fastText, GloVe].


This detailed description of the `data` folder clarifies the contents and purpose of each file, making it easier for others to understand the data used in the project. Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with specific information relevant to your project.
