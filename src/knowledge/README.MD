## Knowledge

The `knowledge` folder houses the components related to managing and accessing Milan's medical knowledge base. This includes the structured knowledge base itself, as well as any modules responsible for querying and retrieving information from it.

* **`medical_knowledge_base.json` (or equivalent)**:  This file contains the structured medical knowledge base used by Milan.  Describe the format (e.g., JSON, graph database) and the type of information stored (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications).  Be specific about the source of this data if possible (e.g., curated from a public dataset, extracted from medical literature).

* **`knowledge_retriever.py`**: This module contains the logic for querying and retrieving information from the medical knowledge base. It defines functions that take user queries as input and return relevant information from the knowledge base. The retrieval methods used (e.g., keyword search, semantic search, graph traversal) should be described here.

* **`knowledge_graph.py`** (If applicable): If your medical knowledge base is represented as a knowledge graph, this module contains functions for building, managing, and querying the graph.  It might use a graph database library (e.g., Neo4j, NetworkX) or a custom implementation.

* **`[Other knowledge-related modules]`**:  Describe any other modules or files related to knowledge management, such as modules for updating the knowledge base, validating its contents, or handling different knowledge representation formats. For example:
    * **`knowledge_base_updater.py`**: This module contains functions for automatically updating the medical knowledge base with new information from external sources.
    * **`knowledge_validator.py`**: This module implements functions for validating the integrity and consistency of the medical knowledge base.


This description of the `knowledge` folder clarifies how medical knowledge is stored, accessed, and managed within the Milan project.  Adapt this to reflect the specific files and functionalities in your project.  If the `knowledge` folder contains subfolders, provide similar detailed descriptions for those as well.
