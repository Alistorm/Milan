## src

The `src` folder contains the core source code for the Milan application, structuring the project's components for clarity and maintainability. It serves as the main entry point and houses the core logic.

* **`main.py`**: This script runs the Milan application, initializing components like the conversational AI model, medical knowledge base, multimodal analysis (if applicable), and the vector database connection. It sets up the UI and starts the main interaction loop.

* **`chat/`**: See [Chat Folder README](chat/README.md) for details.

* **`helpers/`**: See [Helpers Folder README](helpers/README.md) for details.

* **`knowledge/`**: See [Knowledge Folder README](knowledge/README.md) for details.

* **`vectors/`**: See [Vectors Folder README](vectors/README.md) for details.

This description clarifies `src` as the central code repository, organizing functional components.
