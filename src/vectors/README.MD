## Vectors

The `vectors` folder contains the code and resources related to interacting with the vector database used in Milan. This includes modules for storing and retrieving vector embeddings of medical concepts, as well as any utilities for managing the vector database itself.

* **`vector_store.py`**: This module provides the interface for interacting with the vector database. It defines functions for adding new vectors to the database, querying the database for similar vectors, and managing the database connection.  Specify the vector database technology used (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate) and any relevant configuration details.

* **`embedding_generator.py`**: This module contains functions for generating vector embeddings of medical concepts. It specifies the embedding model used (e.g., Sentence-BERT, BioBERT) and any preprocessing steps applied before generating embeddings. This module is crucial for converting textual medical information into a format suitable for similarity search in the vector database.

* **`vector_database_utils.py`**: This module includes utility functions for managing the vector database, such as creating and deleting indexes, optimizing query performance, and handling database migrations. It may also include functions for evaluating the quality of the vector embeddings and the effectiveness of the similarity search.

* **`[Other vector-related modules]`**: Describe any other modules related to vector management or specific vector search techniques.  For example:
    * **`semantic_search.py`**: This module implements functions for performing semantic search using the vector database. It might include different search strategies or ranking algorithms.
    * **`vector_visualization.py`**: This module contains functions for visualizing vector embeddings and exploring relationships between medical concepts in the vector space.

* **`vectors.db` (or equivalent)**: This might be the actual vector database file itself, if stored locally.  If using a cloud-based vector database, this file might contain connection details or configuration parameters.  Describe the file and its purpose.

This description of the `vectors` folder explains how vector embeddings are generated, stored, and used within the Milan project for tasks like semantic search and knowledge retrieval.  Remember to adapt this information to accurately reflect the files, modules, and specific vector database technology used in your project.
