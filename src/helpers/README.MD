## Helpers

The `helpers` folder contains utility modules and functions that provide support to the core functionalities of Milan. These helper functions are designed to be reusable and modular, improving code organization and maintainability.

* **`data_preprocessing.py`**: This module contains functions for preprocessing the data used in the project. This may include cleaning and formatting the medical knowledge base, processing audio and video data for multimodal analysis, and preparing the data for model training and fine-tuning.  Specific preprocessing steps like tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction are implemented here.

* **`model_utils.py`**: This module provides helper functions for working with the AI models, such as loading pre-trained models, defining model architectures, and implementing custom training loops.  It may also include functions for model evaluation and performance monitoring.

* **`multimodal_feature_extraction.py`**: (If applicable) This module contains functions specifically designed for extracting relevant features from audio and video data. This could include extracting voice pitch, intensity, and speaking rate from audio, as well as facial landmarks and expression features from video.

* **`api_integration.py`**: This module handles the integration with external APIs, such as the Mistral AI API or any other APIs used for accessing medical information or other services.  It manages API requests, authentication, and data handling.


* **`[Other helper modules]`**: [Describe any other helper modules included in the folder, such as modules for visualization, logging, or error handling. Be specific about the purpose of each module and the functions it provides.] For example:
    * **`visualization_utils.py`**:  Provides functions for visualizing data, model performance, and other relevant metrics. This could include generating plots, charts, and other visual representations.
    * **`logging_utils.py`**: Sets up and manages logging for the application, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.


This detailed description of the `helpers` folder helps to understand the supporting functionalities and how they contribute to the overall project.  Remember to tailor this description to match the specific files and functions within your project's `helpers` folder.
